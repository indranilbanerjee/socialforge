- `hooks/hooks.json` — 4 hooks: SessionStart (timeout-protected), PreToolUse (compliance), SubagentStart (brand injection), Stop (quality gate)
- `.mcp.json` — 9 HTTP connectors (Notion, Canva, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, Figma, fal.ai, Replicate, Asana)
- `settings.json` — Model inheritance config

#### Skills (3)
- **brand-manager** — 8-step brand setup with Quick Start (5 questions), progressive disclosure, pre-flight validation
- **parse-calendar** — Parse DOCX/XLSX/Notion/text calendars into structured calendar-data.json
- **index-assets** — AI-powered asset indexing with Gemini Vision, crop feasibility, style reference identification

#### Agents (5)

- maxTurns on all 5 agents (10-25 turns)
- Timeout + fallback on all API/network operations
